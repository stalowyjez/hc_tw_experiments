Categories of tests, depending on their source. Most information by Michael Haythorpe.

 - generalized_petersen: Generalized Petersen Graph with n = 3 or 5 mod 6, so precisely three Hamiltonian cycles exist.
 - flower_snarks: Isaacs' Flower snarks modified by the addition of a single edge to introduce approximately (2^(N/8))/3 Hamiltonian cycles.
 - uniquely_fleischner: Uniquely Hamiltonian graph, construction by Fleischner.
 - uniquely_at: Uniquely Hamiltonian graph, construction by Aldred and Thomassen.
 - sheehan: Maximally Uniquely Hamiltonian graph, construction by Sheehan.
 - combined_fleischner: Combined smaller graphs, mostly from uniquely_fleischner category.
 - reduction_domset: Reduction from Dominating Set.
 - reduction_nqueens: Reduction from N-queens.
 - reduction_insanity: Reduction from Generalized Instant Insanity.
 - reduction_bellringing: Reduction from Bellringing.
 - reduction_unium: Reduction from commercial videogame Unium.
 - other: A few unclassified tests.
